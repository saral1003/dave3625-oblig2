## Use Case 2 - Regression algorithm

I have chosen to use a regression analysis algorithm for the second use case, which is supposed to predict the amount of passengers on a bus from a specific date. 
I think it would be the choice for this use case because the number is a continuous value. It's also supposed to predict the percentage score which is usual for a regression algorithm. 
I don't think it's suitable to have a classification with specific categories when the numeric value is not discrete.
